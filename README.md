Gently will be a tool for designing and analysing control systems.

It is being written in [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/ "Hy"), and aims to provide an expressive domain-specific language for designing and analysing control systems.

It builds on [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "python-control") package.
