# Gently

Gently is a tool for designing and analysing control systems. It is not complete and in active development.

It is being written in [Hy](http://hylang.org/ "Hy") (a dialect of Lisp embedded in Python) and aims to provide an expressive domain-specific language for designing and analysing control systems.

It uses [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "python-control") package for control systems related operations.

## Installing

Gently requires Python 3. If you are familiar with Python and know how to install a package with pip, here is how to install Gently:

    pip install gently

If you are not sure what this is, you can read the [installation guide](https://github.com/celaleddin/gently/blob/master/docs/install.md "How to install Gently?").
