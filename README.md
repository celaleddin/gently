Gently
======

Gently is a tool for designing and analysing control systems. It is in active development and far from complete even in the sense of basic functionality.

It is being written in [Hy](http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/ "Hy") (a dialect of Lisp which is embedded in Python) and aims to provide an expressive domain-specific language for designing and analysing control systems.

It uses [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "python-control") package for control systems related operations.
